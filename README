The way this works:

An Envelope holds actual money and is tied to a current budget record.
A Budget record is a single budget period with an amount budgeted for that period.
A Schedule maintains a budget schedule, automatically creates new budgets as the periods arrive, and assigns the Envelope to the current budget period.
