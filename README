The way this works:

An Envelope holds actual money and is tied to a current budget record.
A Budget record is a single budget period with an amount budgeted for that period.
A Schedule maintains a budget schedule, automatically creates new budgets as the periods arrive, and assigns the Envelope to the current budget period.


__ ROADMAP __
X	1) Simple envelopes - deposit actual money, distribute to envelopes waiting to be spent.
X	2) Static budgets - record on an envelope how much it SHOULD contain.
	3) Recurring budgets - every X period of time the budget SHOULD be reset to Y dollars.
	4) Tagged transactions
